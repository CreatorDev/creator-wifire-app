## Setting up the WiFire board with the MPLAB ICD 3 In-Circuit Debugger

To use Microchip’s [MPLAB® ICD3 In-circuit debugger tool](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV164035) you'll need an appropriate adaptor board or cable to connect the ICD3 to the WiFire. The straight-through adaptor cable shown below ([Microchip part no. AC164110](http://www.digikey.co.nz/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/AC164110/AC164110-ND/1212490)) converts the RJ11 connection of the ICD3 to the 6-way inline connection of the WiFire.
