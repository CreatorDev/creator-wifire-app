## Setting up the WiFire board with the MPLAB ICD 3 In-Circuit Debugger

To use Microchip’s MPLAB® ICD3 In-circuit debugger tool you'll need an appropriate adaptor board or cable to connect the ICD3 to the WiFire. The straight-through adaptor cable shown below (Microchip part no. AC164110) converts the RJ11 connection of the ICD3 to the 6-way inline connection of the Wifire.

Alternatively you can make your own adaptor using the pinouts illustrated below.
